# mnist-ai-up (Deep learning intro)

This project teaches you how to use `machine learning` to recognize handwriteen digits. Consider this the `Hello World` of `AI`.

I decided to use `javascript` and `microservices` to deploy this project, because it makes easy to run examples, without the need of deploying servers or learn a new programming language.

This network recognizes digits using a `multilayer perceptron`. I strongly recommend you to watch the videos bellow to understand the mathematical concepts behind this algorithm:

## Details

I'm using `Javascript` and `AWS lambda`. The interface is based on [this tutorial](https://github.com/llSourcell/how_to_deploy_a_keras_model_to_production).

It uses [Neataptic](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic) to train the network and [AWS lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) to serve the API endpoint.

I decided to use `Neataptic` instea of `Keras`, because it opens the `possibility` to use `Neuroevolution` to evolve `networks` instead of human designed `neural nets`. I recommed this article to understand more about `Neuroevolution`:

`Neuroevolution` is increasingly getting better.

## Demo

[Live demo](https://xzr0dc9xba.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/development/mnist.html)

## Setup

```
$ npm install
```

## Train new model

```
$ node mnist-train.js
```

## Deploy

Install [Up](https://github.com/apex/up) 

```
$ up
```

## Notes

The `build` hook in `up.json` simply runs `make`, which ensures that the `./node-v8.4.0-linux-x64` binary is downloaded and present, Make is used so that this process only happens once.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "build": "make"
  }
}
```

The `proxy.command` script is run inside Lambda to start your server. You can think of this as `npm start`, however you'd likely want `npm start` to be `node app.js` for local development. Defining `proxy.command` is strictly for running in production.

```json
{
  "proxy": {
    "command": "./node-v8.7.0-linux-x64/bin/node app.js"
  }
}
```

Also note that `./node-v8.7.0-linux-x64` is placed in .gitignore so it's not checked into GIT. Up will ignore these by default, so we negate it with `!node-v8.7.0-linux-x64` in .upignore.
